As a user, when I hit the front page I should see a energy-populated cloropleth d3 graph of the United States

When I click on a state, I should be taken to a show page for that state

On a states show page I should see a labeled bar chart for energy type of coal

On a states show page I should see an image of the states

On a states show page I should see an option to compare different energy types

When I click on a energy filter, I should see the chart repopulate with the respective data for the energy filter type

When I select 2 filter to compare (on same chart) I should see the chart populate with data from both filters each in a different color

When I clear the filter the chart should default back to showing only data for coal on the current state

When I click the 'back' button I should be redirected to the front page ^^
